# [Project 1: Data Science Purchase Estimator: Project Overview](https://github.com/hydrobot004/XG-BoostML_Algorithms)
* Created a tool deployed on AWS Sagemaker that predicts the likelyhood of bank customers making a purchase 
* Using XG-BoostML_Algorithms to train, test and predict employing a confusion matrix.

## Code and Resources Used
* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages/Libraries: boto3, re, sys, math, json, os, sagemaker, urllib.request, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pyplot
* Dataframe Shape (28831, 61) (12357, 61)


# [Project 2: Data Science IOT Anomaly, Risk, and Failure Prediction Detection: Project Overview](https://github.com/hydrobot004/pumpsensors-01)
* Any dataset can be implemented from similar IoT related devices that produce time series data.
* This project can help you to learn:
**- how to approach sensors data
**- how to find anomalies which can identify pumps or other IOT devices at risk,
**- slopes in the time series record, another indicator of potential failure. 
**- python code which can be run on AWS Sagemaker or a desktop Jupyter notebook 

## Code and Resources Used
